# LLM Prototypes

This repository contains prototype applications demonstrating the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) for different tasks, including basic LLM interaction and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).

## Poem Generator

The `poem-generator` directory contains a simple Streamlit application that allows users to input a topic and receive a Shakespearean-style poem generated by an LLM (specifically using the Groq API).

### Files

- `app.py`: The main Streamlit application file.
- `chains.py`: Defines the LLM chain responsible for generating the poem. It uses a prompt template and the configured LLM.
- `models.py`: Contains the function to create and configure the LLM model.
- `prompts.py`: Defines the prompt template used to instruct the LLM.

## Poem Generator with RAG

The `poem-generator-rag` directory extends the basic poem generator by incorporating Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). This allows the LLM to generate poems based on information retrieved from external documents (in this case, uploaded PDF files).

## Quiz Generator

The `quiz-generator` directory contains a Streamlit application that allows users to specify a topic, the number of questions, and the difficulty level for a quiz. The application then uses an LLM to generate a quiz based on these parameters.

## Setup Instructions

To run these applications, you will need to set up a Python environment and install the necessary dependencies.

1.  **Create a Virtual Environment (recommended):**

    ```bash
    python3 -m venv .
    source bin/activate  # On macOS and Linux
    # .\.venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
    ```

2.  **Install Dependencies:**

    Navigate to each application directory (`poem-generator`, `poem-generator-rag`, `quiz-generator`) and install the required libraries. Alternatively, you can install all dependencies at once if you are running the applications from the root directory.

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

    *(Based on the `instructions.txt` and code, the necessary packages are `python-dotenv`, `langchain`, `langchain_groq`, `streamlit`, and `langchain_huggingface`.)*

    You can create the `requirements.txt` file by running:

    ```bash
    pip freeze > requirements.txt
    ```
ÌŒ
3.  **Set up Environment Variables:**

    You will need to set up your Groq API key. Create a `.env` file in the root directory (or in each application directory) and add your API key:

    ```
    GROQ_API_KEY=YOUR_GROQ_API_KEY
    ```

    Replace `YOUR_GROQ_API_KEY` with your actual Groq API key.

## Running the Applications

To run each Streamlit application, navigate to its respective directory in your terminal and use the following command:

```bash
cd <project-name>
streamlit run app.py
